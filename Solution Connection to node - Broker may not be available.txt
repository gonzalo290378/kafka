I was able to reproduce your issue and to solve it. I'll record some more instructions soon, but can you please confirm these work for you?



First, stop Kafka and Zookeeper.



Then, please run these commands on your end, on WSL2, one by one



sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1
and



sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6=1


This will ask for your password the first time.



When the two commands have succeeded, relaunch Zookeeper and Kafka, and you should be able to connect from your Java programs, without a problem.



Please confirm if it's all good for you, and I will include these commands in the course :)
